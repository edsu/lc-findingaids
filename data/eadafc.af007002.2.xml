         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>There are approximately 140,000 Ifugao living in scattered districts
		  over some 170 square miles in northern Luzon. They are agrarian farmers who
		  have perfected a system of sustainable rice terracing uniquely suited to the
		  heavy rainstorms and rugged terrain of northern Luzon, Philippines. In their
		  tribal society, rice is more than a basic sustenance; it also serves as a
		  medium of exchange and a signifier of status. Rituals, ceremonies, and events
		  are tightly interwoven into the Ifugao people's daily lives. The characteristic
		  richness and diversity of the Ifugao agriculture, religion, and music is
		  strongly evident in The Harold C. Conklin Philippine Collection, which includes
		  what arguably is one of the largest, most comprehensive set of audio recordings
		  on the Ifugao in existence. It documents continuity and change in some of the
		  most important features of Ifugao culture over the course of forty years.</p>
         <p>The recordings chronicle a wide range of Ifugao ceremonies, events,
		  rituals, and sub-rituals, with much of the collection divided between strictly
		  oral, strictly instrumental, and combined oral/instrumental field recordings.
		  Field recordings document, for example, mythical or genealogical recitations,
		  women's rituals, chants, invocations, rice harvesting, storytelling, children's
		  games, language exercises, voice letters, interviews, and discussions. While a
		  handful of the recordings are in the languages of Buhid, Hanunóo, Ilongot,
		  Kallāhan, or English, the majority are recorded in the Ifugao Baynīnan
		  dialect, one of the twenty-three dialects spoken by the Ifugao. With regard to
		  geographical coverage, the documentation comes from twenty-seven of
		  approximately one hundred and fifty agricultural districts, thereby providing a
		  respectable sampling of the Ifugao. Therefore, due to its topical,
		  geographical, and temporal scope, the recordings not only capture the exact
		  details of ritualized Ifugao ceremonies, they situate them within the larger
		  cultural context. Additional recording locations in the Philippines include:
		  Tukukan, Nueva Vizcaya-Dupax del Sur, Nueva Vizcaya-Kakidūgen, and Mindoro
		  Oriental.</p>
         <p>Conklin began making original field recordings of the Ifugao in 1961.
		  He used a combination of tape recorders (Fi-cord, Nagra, Sony, and Uher),
		  recording formats (discs, reel-to-reel tapes and cassette tapes), and recording
		  speeds (1 7/8, 3 3⁄4, 7 1⁄2, and 15 ips) in the course of his field work,
		  adopting new technologies as they became available. Recordings on 5-inch
		  reel-to-reel tapes and sixty-minute cassettes are the predominant original
		  formats in this collection, which totals 262 first-generation sound recordings.
		  </p>
         <p>All recordings were originally given three distinct numbers by
		  Conklin. In this system, the first number denotes the year, the second denotes
		  the reel or cassette number, and the third denotes the side of the reel or
		  cassette as noted (example: original field recording 61.5b is the B-side of the
		  fifth recording made in 1961). With the exception of twenty-four recordings
		  made in 1955, 1960, 1965, 1966, 1970, and 1977, Conklin is the primary
		  recordist or interviewer for all of the original Ifugao recordings. </p>
         <p>A copy of Conklin's own Philippine Collection 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Catalog</title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Expanded Contents</title>, which provides
		item-level descriptive data on original field recordings, is included in this
		collection. The prefatory material in Conklin's Catalog lists recording
		locations, languages, and individuals (interviewees, interviewers, and
		recording operators), provides a key to his abbreviations and symbols, and
		indexes specific field recordings by instrument, ceremony, event, and ritual.
		This is a useful resource that can be used in conjunction with the AFC 2001/007
		Reference Concordance to facilitate use of the audio materials. The Reference
		CD Concordance lists the original field recording number, the corresponding CD,
		track duration, date of original recording, original format, and track content
		description. In addition, the database for this collection allows for term and
		phrase searching using Ifugao terms found under the Appendices.</p>

         <head>Biographical History</head>
         <p>Harold C. Conklin (professor emeritus, Yale University) is a renowned
		  anthropologist, linguist, ethnobiologist, and preeminent authority on the
		  Ifugao and Hanunóo people of the Philippines. Born in Easton, Pennsylvania, in
		  1926, Conklin developed an early interest in anthropology and the history and
		  culture of Native Americans that was supported and encouraged by his family. By
		  the end of his high school career, Conklin had formed a number of influential
		  friendships with American Indians, worked as the only non-Indian National Youth
		  Association Indian Counselor, and served as a part-time volunteer at the
		  American Museum of Natural History, where he worked under the supervision of
		  curator and department chairperson, Clark Wissler. </p>
         <p>By 1943, Conklin's interests in high school, particularly in American
		  Indian studies and linguistics, had prepared him for undergraduate study at the
		  University of California, Berkeley. In his first year there, he was introduced
		  to Austronesian languages through a hasher (cook's assistant) job at the Gamma
		  Phi Beta sorority house, where he first began speaking, reading, and writing in
		  Malay. In his second semester, Conklin built upon this introduction to Malay by
		  enrolling in an advanced linguistics course where students were assigned the
		  task of transcribing Australian and American broadcasts for Indonesians living
		  throughout the archipelago, then occupied by the Japanese during World War
		  II.</p>
         <p>In July of 1944, Conklin was inducted into the U.S. Army and served
		  two years with the 158th Regimental Combat Team in the Philippine Islands,
		  northern Luzon. After arranging to be discharged in the Philippines in 1946,
		  Conklin spent a year and a half conducting serious anthropological research and
		  fieldwork in Manila, Mindoro, and Palawan. During this period, he made his
		  first set of Philippine recordings, and was given locally crafted artifacts,
		  plant leaves, and cuttings in exchange for his freely given store of seed
		  beads, post-war relief clothing, and medicines. The resulting collection of
		  artifacts was later donated to the Philippine National Museum. During his stay
		  in Manila, Conklin was also given a serendipitous crash course, by botanist
		  H.H. Bartlett, on the proper way to prepare, press, and store the botanical
		  specimens he had accumulated during his stay in the Philippines. Upon his
		  return to the United States in 1948, Conklin finished his undergraduate work at
		  Berkeley, but not before cataloging his collection of bamboo manuscripts
		  written by natives from Mindoro and Palawan, publishing two articles on the
		  Mindoro, and typing up a 600-page Hanunóo-English dictionary. </p>
         <p>During his first two years as a Yale graduate student (1950-51),
		  Conklin continued to engage in scholarly dialogue with numerous faculty
		  members, visiting scholars, and fellow students who shared his interest in
		  anthropology and linguistics. From 1952 to 1954, he returned to the Philippines
		  to complete fieldwork on the Hanunóo people for his dissertation. At this
		  time, he began making his second set of Philippine recordings with equipment
		  lent to him by Moses Asch of Folkways Records. Although he officially completed
		  his graduate research in 1955, Conklin's analysis of the Hanunóo, based on his
		  four field trips to Mindoro between 1947 and 1958, was not completed until
		  1961. Almost immediately thereafter, he began studying the Ifugao of northern
		  Luzon in order to provide cultural contrasts to his work with the Hanunóo.
		  From 1961 to 1973, Conklin continued his fieldwork in northern Luzon, making
		  six field trips during this twelve-year span. The audio material he recorded
		  during these visits comprises his third and most comprehensive set of
		  Philippine recordings. </p>
         <p>In 1954, Conklin accepted a position at Columbia University, where,
		  for the next eight years, he taught and explored his research interests in
		  cognition, kinship, language use, and folk classification. From 1962 to the
		  present, Conklin has taught at Yale University, where he has continued to
		  pursue research on shifting cultivations, ethnology, and ecologies of tropical
		  forested areas of the Pacific Basin. A prolific writer, Conklin has authored
		  over thirty scholarly essays and seven books. In addition, he has contributed
		  to, co-authored or edited over forty other publications and provided the source
		  material for the Folkways recording, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Hanunóo Music From the Philippines</title>
		(1955). Conklin has also served as the Chair of the Anthropology Department,
		Director of Graduate Studies, and Curator and Head of the Division of
		Anthropology at the Peabody Museum, Yale University. He holds professional
		affiliations with the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of
		Arts and Sciences, and the American Anthropological Association, and continues
		to remain an active scholar and mentor in the anthropology department at Yale.
		He currently resides in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>

            <p>From 1961 to 1995, Harold C. Conklin made approximately ten field
		  trips to northern Luzon to record the audio material in this collection. These
		  recordings, plus twenty-four recordings made by friends and acquaintances,
		  comprise his third and last set of field recordings made in the Philippines. In
		  September 1999, Conklin loaned this third set of Philippine recordings to the
		  Archive of Folk Culture (AFC) at the Library of Congress so that duplicate
		  copies could be made. The Cutting Corporation recording laboratory (Bethesda,
		  Md.) was contracted by the Library to produce two reference CD copies and one
		  10-inch preservation reel-to-reel tape copy, and completed the duplication of
		  the Conklin recordings in the fall of 2001. The preservation reel-to-reel tapes
		  and one copy of the reference CDs were retained by the AFC, while all original
		  field recordings and the second copy of reference CDs were returned to the
		  collector in accordance with the terms of the AFC's agreement with him. After
		  the audio duplication of materials was completed, the collection was organized

            <p>In addition to this collection, the Archive of Folk Culture holds
		  duplicate copies of Conklin's earlier Hanunóo and Buhíd audio field
		  recordings. The first set, accessioned in 1949, is the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Harold C. Conklin Recordings of Folk Music from
		  the Pacific Islands</title> (AFS 9584 - 9589). These are included with
		Conklin's first set of Hanunóo recordings, originally made in 1946-1947, and
		comprise a sampling of Ifugao, Bontoc, Kankanay, and Ibanag recordings from the
		Cordillera of northwestern Luzon.</p>
            <p>The second and larger of these two sets was accessioned in 1988 and is
		  titled 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Harold C. Conklin Philippine Recordings</title>,
		AFC 1986/034 (AFS 26,750 - 26,767). This second set of Hanunóo recordings,
		dating from 1952-1958, includes a sampling of Buhíd recordings from regions
		north and west of interior parts of southern Mindoro, where Hanunóo is
		spoken.</p>
            <p>Additional points of access to Conklin materials can be found in the

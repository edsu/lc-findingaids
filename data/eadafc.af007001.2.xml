         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>While Sam Eskin's interests were broad in scope, his multi-format
		  collection of manuscripts, published materials, sound recordings, and still
		  images concentrates and builds upon his early interests in American folk
		  music.</p>
         <p> The collection centers around field recordings Eskin made in the
		  United States from 1938 to 1966. Not only are these recordings the source
		  material for a number of his original song notations and transcriptions,
		  certain performers' names reappear in his correspondence, business records,
		  notes, and photographs. Another topical connection between the manuscript and
		  audio portions of the collection is bawdy humor. From the beginning, Eskin
		  marked risque field recordings with a Greek delta symbol, and created a
		  <emph render="italic">Humorous</emph> subdivision for his bawdy song
		  transcriptions. He also maintained a healthy file of limericks that mirror the
		  tone and intent of his "delta" recordings. </p>
         <p>The manuscript portion of Sam Eskin Collection contains original and
		  printed material, broken into eight main categories: 1) administrative records
		  related to the transfer and acquisition of the collection; 2)
		  clippings/articles related to folk music; 3) Eskin's correspondence with other
		  enthusiasts, performers, and scholars; 4) Eskin's notes and drafts for
		  lectures, presentations, and radio interviews; 5) mailings and advertisements
		  from societies and studios, including festival programs and newsletters; 6)
		  ideas, notes, quotations, and song lists jotted or typed onto slips of paper;
		  7) a collection of bawdy limericks; and 8) a comprehensive collection of song
		  notations and transcriptions. The last category includes the majority of the
		  manuscript items. Many of these notations were taken directly from original
		  disc and reel-to-reel field recordings and remain in subdivided categories
		  organized by Eskin. It should also be noted that, while a handful of these
		  manuscript items are related to traditional Mexican music, the majority of
		  these manuscripts are directly related to folk music in the United States.</p>
         <p>Prominent individuals Eskin corresponded with include: Jorge Luis
		  Arriola, Sidney Robertson Cowell, Arthur Kyle Davis, E.L. Doctorow, J.D. Elder,
		  Alta and Austin Fife, Jim Geary, Bess Lomax Hawes, Joseph Hickerson, Joe
		  Helmer, George List, Seymour B. Liebman, Alan Lomax, Ben Gray Lumpkin, Dorothy
		  Mehrton, Archie Leroy Musick, Tom Paxton, Pete Seeger, Irwin Silber, and
		  Margaret Valiant.</p>
         <p>The audio portion of this collection consists of disc and reel-to-reel
		  field recordings, duplicates, and commercial recordings. A complete list of
		  commercial recordings transferred to the Motion Picture, Broadcast, and
		  Recorded Sound Division, Library of Congress is available in the Folklife
		  Reading Room. Even more than the manuscript series, these sound recordings
		  reflect Eskin's diverse musical interests, his exploration into different
		  genres, and his experimentation with field recording techniques. Although Eskin
		  did not keep formal records of field recording sessions, information regarding
		  songs, locations, and performers are noted on disc sleeves, reel-to-reel boxes,
		  and select items located in the manuscript portion of the collection. While a
		  few of the American performers in these recordings were prominent artists at
		  the time, Eskin made a number of recordings with artists who did not achieve
		  commercial recognition until much later in their careers. Some of Eskin's
		  recordings are performed by unidentified artists.</p>
         <p>Eskin's first field recordings were made on discs, which he used from
		  1940 to 1949. During this time, his many cross-country trips from New York to
		  California were spent recording American folk music. In the late 1940s and
		  early 1950s, Eskin made audio copies of these field recordings on 16-inch
		  preservation discs. Concerned over the viability of magnetic tape, he also made
		  16-inch discs of reel-to-reel field recordings made from the early 1950s, and
		  transferred a small selection of commercial jazz and blues songs, commercial
		  releases of international music, radio broadcasts, and miscellaneous recordings
		  onto the 16-inch disc format. The 12-inch discs included in this collection
		  appear to be given to Eskin by an unidentified collector.</p>
         <p>Eskin switched to reel-to-reel tape in 1949. When it was clear that
		  magnetic tape had become a recording standard, Eskin migrated his disc
		  recordings onto tape, and began duplicating of his own tapes, other collectors'
		  recordings, and commercial songs or albums. While he continued making field
		  recordings in the United States, beginning in 1950 Eskin collected music during
		  his more frequent travels abroad. His visits to Mexico, Israel, Spain, and the
		  British Isles yielded a respectable cache of field recordings, which are
		  supplemented by recordings he made in the Middle East, the Caribbean, and East
		  Asia. Also included in AFC 1999/004 are two sets of commercial recordings
		  containing songs performed by Eskin: Sam Eskin Songs and Ballads (four 10-inch
		  discs, 2 sets) and Vistas of Israel (four 16-inch discs).</p>
         <p>In 1952, Eskin duplicated thirty-one of his reel-to-reel tape field
		  recordings for the Archive of Folk Song (AFS 10,501-10,506). Eskin also
		  collaborated on a second duplication project to make copies of his earliest
		  disc field recordings for the Archive of Folk Song in 1960 (AFS 11,712-11,719).
		  Additional original recordings used in these duplication projects are included
		  in this collection.</p>
         <p>The graphic images in this collection consist of 55 black-and-white
		  prints of various sizes, one color print, two negatives, and a handful of
		  unused postcards depicting views of instruments and instumentalists. Two thirds
		  of the photographic subjects have been identified as field recording
		  performers.</p>
         <p>The remaining subjects, while unidentified, are also assumed to be
		  performers. The database created for this collection contains listings and
		  locations for the graphic images and musical transcriptions and notations, as
		  well as searchable title, performer, and descriptive fields pertaining to
		  Eskin's instantaneous discs, reel-to-reel tapes, and original field recordings.
		  This database is available in the Folklife Reading Room.</p>

         <head>Biographical History</head>
         <p>Sam Eskin was a self-made man who tried his hand at a variety of
		  professions and eventually found an outlet for his artistic expression in folk
		  music. Born in Washington, D.C. on July 5, 1898, Eskin grew up in Baltimore but
		  left home at a young age to explore the world. Consequently, his formal
		  education ended with the eighth grade. Over the course of the next twenty-five
		  years, Eskin's experiences as a taxi driver, clerk, magazine reporter, logger,
		  merchant seaman, cattle hand, cannery worker, and traveling United Parcel
		  Service (UPS) consultant exposed him to a wide variety of songs, including work
		  songs, sea shanties, and American versions of traditional ballads. In 1938, he
		  began seriously collecting and performing folk music. With the job security and
		  benefits accrued after a fifteen-year stint with UPS, by 1945, Eskin was free
		  to pursue his interests in the collection and performance of folk music.</p>
         <p>During the period between 1938 and 1945, Eskin gathered material with
		  a growing awareness of folksong scholarship, reading widely on the subject to
		  familiarize himself with the significance of folksongs as cultural and social
		  documentation, and as an aesthetic means of expression for the people who sang
		  them. As a self-taught folklorist, Eskin's primary interests were the
		  collection, preservation, and evaluation of American folksongs, indigenous
		  music, dance music, primitive drumming, oral storytelling, and oral histories.
		  Eskin's papers and correspondence document an awareness of folk music's
		  connection with folklore and musicology, which is reflected in the sound
		  recordings he collected in the field.</p>
         <p>Eskin's interest in recording folk music came at a period of
		  technological transition, and his early and successful investments in UPS stock
		  provided him with the financial freedom to experiment with newly emerging
		  recording formats. Eskin embraced new technologies and upgraded his disc and
		  reel-to-reel tape recorders, amplifiers, and speakers on a regular basis. At
		  his permanent home in Woodstock, New York, he was infamous for showing new
		  friends and visitors the eight foot long wooden optimal base speaker he had
		  built. The evolution of sound recording techniques in America from the 1930s to
		  the 1960s is reflected in Eskin's own moves from acetate discs to wire
		  recordings to reel-to-reel magnetic tape.</p>
         <p>From 1945 to 1953, Eskin embarked on several cross-country trips
		  through the United States and Mexico, traveling from state to state in a silver
		  trailer from which he made field recordings, notations, and transcriptions. By
		  the mid 1950s, Eskin began a series of trips abroad, visiting Jamaica, Cuba,
		  England, Scotland, Spain, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Morocco, Hong Kong, the
		  Philippines, India, and Thailand, while often recording and collecting samples
		  of the local music and lore he encountered. With his casual demeanor and
		  energetic passion for music, Eskin easily made new acquaintances and maintained
		  correspondence with a number of musicians he met in his travels.</p>
         <p> Eskin also shared his thoughts on folk music through correspondence
		  and visits with other folklorists in the field, including renowned collectors
		  and performers Pete Seeger and Sydney Robertson Cowell. Professionally, Eskin
		  lectured at various universities, workshops, and folk festivals, and released
		  two commercial albums, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sea Shanties and Loggers
		  Songs</title> , and the four-disc set 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sam Eskin Songs and
		  Ballads</title> . From 1948 to 1972, working with fellow enthusiasts and music
		producers Emory Cook and Moses Asch, Eskin also contributed original source
		material, co-produced, or performed on 19 albums released under the Cook
		Laboratories/Folkways Records label. </p>

            <head>Acquisition</head>
            <p>In 1970, Sam Eskin donated all of the field and commercial recordings
		  he made between 1940 and 1969 to the folklore department of the Cooperstown
		  Graduate Program (CGP) in Cooperstown, New York. Upon the collector's death in
		  1974, all personal manuscripts related to the collection of folk music were
		  presented to CGP by his sons. The collection remained there until the
		  discontinuation of the CPG folklore department in 1979. For the next twenty
		  years, Sam Eskin Collection resided at the New York State Historical
		  Association's (NYSHA) archives until 1999. The materials were transferred to
		  the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in 1999.</p>
            <p>Graduate students Simon Bronner and Lee Livney were the first to
		  process this collection at Cooperstown Graduate Program. Bronner organized and
		  created a track list and outlined a processing procedure for all of Eskin's
		  reel-to-reel tapes, while Livney arranged and cataloged manuscripts in the
		  collection. When the collection was transferred to the New York State
		  Historical Association, it underwent another partial re-organization. Once at
		  the American Folklife Center, Nora Yeh supervised the final processing of Sam
		  Eskin Collection. In the summer of 2000, Sondra Smolek reorganized, rehoused,
		  and created the database for the manuscript portion of the collection. Patricia
		  Baughman processed the documentation on the reel-to-reel tape collection in the
		  fall of 2000. In the summer of 2001, T. Chris Aplin reviewed the sound
		  recordings, completed documentation on the reel collection, and processed the
		  acetate disk collection. In the fall of 2001, Judy Ng rehoused the sound
		  recordings, updated the collection's finding aid, and updated the collection
		  database.</p>

            <p>Sam Eskin personally duplicated select original field recordings from
		  his collection for the Library of Congress in 1952 and 1960. The first
		  duplication project was accessioned by the Archive of Folk Culture in June 1952
		  (AFS 10,501-10,506 or LWO 1923), and consists of 6 10-inch preservation
		  reel-to-reel tape recordings from 31 of Eskin's reel-to-reel tapes. The second
		  duplication project was accessioned by the Archive of Folk Culture in June 1960
		  (AFS 11,712-11,719 or LWO 2995), and consists of 8 10-inch preservation
		  reel-to-reel tape recordings from 142 of Eskin's acetate discs.</p>
            <p>Since some of the original tapes and almost all of the original discs
		  used for both duplication projects can be found in Sam Eskin Collection (AFC
		  1999/004), cross-references to both sets of duplicated recordings and all
		  information pertaining to original recordings have been incorporated into the
		  collection database (See zip disk in Folder 1, Box 1).</p>
            <p> In addition to the materials in this collection, the Library holds
		  eight commercial recordings with ties to Eskin appearing as a performer,
		  contributor, or producer. Refer to the Library of Congress' Online Public
		  Access Catalog (

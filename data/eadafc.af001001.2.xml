         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>Woody Guthrie was a prolific artist known for his achievements as a
		  singer-songwriter and as an author. Guthrie toured and performed for a period
		  of approximately twenty-five years, exhibiting a life-long dedication to social
		  activism by playing his politically charged music for audiences around the
		  nation. His output included nearly three thousand songs, several novels, and
		  other writings in the form of articles, essays, poems, and letters. In
		  addition, Guthrie also painted, drew cartoons, and often illustrated his
		  writings.</p>
         <p>From 1940 to 1950, Guthrie corresponded with staff at the Library of
		  Congress. The most significant and frequent correspondence occurred between
		  1940 and 1942, when Guthrie wrote regularly to the Assistant in Charge of the
		  Archive of American Folk Song, Alan Lomax. Their correspondence explores
		  political issues, current events, career and recording issues, and includes
		  personal exchanges. In addition, Guthrie sent Lomax prose pieces and other
		  creative writings, some of which are reminiscent of journal or diary entries in
		  their stream-of-consciousness nature. Some pieces are written on paper bags and
		  tissue paper, some include doodles or sketches. In addition, Guthrie sent
		  lyrics of his songs in several formats, including one large hand-bound set,
		  smaller unbound sets, and single pages enclosed in letters. Most of these songs
		  are ballads that used familiar melodies but addressed contemporary situations.
		  Some of the manuscripts were written prior to 1940 and were subsequently sent
		  to Lomax during their correspondence. In some cases Guthrie reworked or
		  annotated old manuscripts before sending them.</p>

         <head>Biographical History and Administrative History</head>
         <p>Woody Guthrie, born in Okemah, Oklahoma in 1912 and raised in Texas,
		  moved to California during the Depression, where he met actor and activist Will
		  Geer and toured migrant labor camps documenting conditions and injustices in
		  the camps for 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Light</title> newspaper. He also performed on
		Los Angeles radio KFVD-LA, singing old-time ballads, some of which he updated
		with lyrics about contemporary issues. Alan Lomax, assistant in charge of the
		Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress, first heard Woody
		Guthrie at a concert in New York City in March of 1940, shortly after Guthrie
		had relocated there.</p>
         <p>Alan Lomax arranged for Guthrie to travel to Washington, D.C. to
		  record an oral life history that included traditional and original songs, and
		  encouraged him to write his autobiography. Guthrie performed on several "Folk
		  Music of America" radio shows hosted by Alan Lomax on CBS's American School of
		  the Air. In New York, Woody Guthrie joined Lomax's sister, Bess Lomax Hawes,
		  Pete Seeger, and others in a singing group, the Almanac Singers, for which
		  Guthrie wrote protest ballads and songs. More information on Woody Guthrie's
		  life and career can be found through the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives
		  at

         <p>The Archive of American Folk Song was founded in 1928 at the Library
		  of Congress to collect and preserve American folksongs. During the years when
		  the earliest Guthrie collections were acquired, from 1940 to 1950, the Archive
		  was directed by: John A. Lomax (1932-1942), Alan Lomax (assistant in charge,
		  1937-1942), Benjamin Botkin (1942-1945), and Duncan Emrich (1946-1954). It was
		  through Alan Lomax's recording projects and his personal friendship with Woody
		  Guthrie that these early materials were added to the Archive. When Alan Lomax's
		  entire collection of papers and recordings was acquired by the American
		  Folklife Center in 2004, additional Woody Guthrie manuscripts were included,
		  which add to the Archive's Guthrie holdings. To reflect its broader mission and
		  collections the Archive was re-named the Archive of Folk Culture in 1981 and is
		  now a part of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress.</p>

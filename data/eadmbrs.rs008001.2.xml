         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Born in Chicago in 1901, Jack Kapp began his phonograph industry career at the
				age of fourteen by working as a part-time shipping clerk for Columbia Records.
				Later he oversaw artists and repertoire for Brunswick, and in 1934, backed by
				the owner of British Decca, Ltd., he founded the American Decca Records
				Company. By substantially lowering the price of popular records on his Decca
				label and selecting artists and repertoire to maximize sales, Kapp made
				American Decca the second largest record company in the U.S. by 1938 and helped
				the industry pull out of a slump attributed to radio broadcasting and the Great
				Depression. Decca artists included immensely popular performers such as Bing
				Crosby, the Boswell Sisters, the Andrews Sisters, the Ink Spots, Ted Lewis, and
				the Guy Lombardo Orchestra. Decca innovations included the first mass marketed
				American "original cast recording" (for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Oklahoma!</title>) and the "album" record package containing notes and
				promotional information.</p>
         <p>During the 1940s, American recording companies, including Kapp's label,
				struggled against new challenges, such as the 1942-1944 recording ban of the
				American Federation of Musicians. The ban was rooted in the concern of
				professional musicians that they lost jobs due to sound films and did not
				benefit economically from the growth of the recording and broadcasting
				industries. In 1940, they elected as president of the American Federation of
				Musicians (AFM) a trumpeter named James Caesar Petrillo. His aggressive actions
				to counter the loss of musicians' jobs due to the prevalence of the jukebox and
				the recorded motion picture soundtrack made Petrillo one of the most famous and
				highly paid union leaders in American history and led to depictions of him in
				the press as a Mussolini-like character often called "Little Caesar."</p>
         <p>In 1942, led by Petrillo, the AFM banned its members from performing for the
				record industry. Petrillo was undeterred by the efforts of such government
				agencies as the Office of War Information and the National War Labor Board to
				end the ban; he even refused President Franklin Roosevelt's request to order
				the musicians back to work. Jack Kapp's Decca Records, followed by most other
				American record and radio transcription companies, agreed to pay royalties to
				the AFM in 1943, but for Columbia and RCA Records, which refused to settle, the
				ban continued. In late 1944, those two companies also came to an agreement with
				the union and the ban ended completely; however, the 1946 passage of the Lea
				Act (often called the "Anti-Petrillo Act") and the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act
				severely weakened the terms of the agreement between the musicians union and
				the recording industry. A new recording ban was put into effect in early 1948,
				but toward the end of the year it was lifted. During the following decade, the
				industry grew both financially and technologically. Petrillo's retirement from
				the AFM in 1958 brought an end to the publicity the union had received during
				the 1940s.</p>
         <p>Jack Kapp died in 1949. His brother Dave succeeded him at Decca.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>Assembled by American Decca Records founder and president Jack Kapp, the
				collection consists of mostly original drawings by various magazine and
				newspaper cartoonists, such as Rube Goldberg, H. T. Webster, Gluyas Williams,
				L. M. Glackens, Burt Thomas, Fred Packer, Clifford Berryman, James Berryman,
				Jack Markow, and David Breger. The drawings, chiefly editorial cartoons,
				reflect the role of the phonograph in American life and offer historical
				commentary on the internal issues of the American phonograph industry,
				particularly the American Federation of Musicians recording ban of 1942-1944.
				The collection also features a framed album cover for the 1943 Decca Records
				cast recording of the musical, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Oklahoma!</title> The
				cast recording became a standard product category for record companies due to
				the immense success of this album.</p>
         <p>Some Jack Kapp correspondence is included in the collection; it is stored in the
				Recorded Sound Reference Center subject files. For more information or to view
				the correspondence, contact a reference librarian in the Recorded Sound
				Reference Center, Library of Congress.</p>

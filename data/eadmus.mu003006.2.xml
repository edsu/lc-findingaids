         <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
         <p>Ernst Bacon, composer, pianist, and conductor was born on May 26, 1898.  He was the son of Dr. Charles S. Bacon and Maria von Rosthorn Bacon, herself a Viennese-trained musician.  He studied at Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, also privately with Alexander Raab, Glenn Dillard Gunn, Ernest Bloch, and Karl Weigl.  Among the numerous awards and grants he received are the Bispham Award, the Ditson and the League of Composers Commission, the Pulitzer fellowship, a Guggenheim fellowship, and grants from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, American Society of Authors, Composers, and Publishers, and The National Endowment for the Arts.  A multi-faceted musician, Bacon composed and conducted symphonies, operas, piano concertos, musical theater, ensemble and solo instrumental and vocal works.  In addition, he concertized as a pianist in Europe and America, and he conducted the WPA orchestra in California from 1935 to 1937.  He taught and administered at  Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester(1926-27), Syracuse University's music department (1945-47), and Converse College in South Carolina (1938-45).  He distinguished himself as a writer with such works as <emph render="underline">Notes on the Piano</emph>, <emph render="underline">The Honor of Music</emph>, and <emph render="underline">Words on Music</emph>.  In <emph render="underline">Our Musical Idioms</emph> Bacon presented a new theory of scale models derived from diatonic scales.  He was also music critic for "The Argonaut," the weekly publication of Converse College.  Ernst Bacon was respected as a philosopher by close circle of friends who were fortunate enough to get to see his unpublished writings, [i.e. <emph render="underline">Imaginary Dialogues</emph> and his many poems].  He was a highly opinionated man, a fact which can be witnessed by the large volume of letters to the editor written to several major and not so major serials.</p>
         <p>Paul Horgan, one of Ernst Bacon's close friends and his sometime collaborator, summarized Ernst Bacon by writing: "...his wonderful variousness of gifts all gather at the center in the name of the art inherent in mankind.  With him, to see deeply is to see in a wide-angled vision; and to create is for him to release his full richness of nature in all his work.  ...If there is no Grand Duke of Weimar now available to give his genius full patronage and opportunity, I think we may, even as we deplore the lack of comforting recognitions and rewards commensurate with his achievement, safely leave the future the proper recognition of Ernst Bacon as a great man and a great artist."</p>
         <p>Bacon was a devoted family man.  He married four times and had six children.  Ernst Bacon died on March 16, 1990 in Orinda, California.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>Materials in the Ernst Bacon Collection span his entire ninety-one year life.  They include five series:  Music, Writings, Correspondence, Iconography, and Miscellaneous materials.  The bulk of materials are found in the Music, Correspondence, and Writings series.</p>
         <p>The Music Series contains holographs, copyist manuscripts, and photoduplications of Ernst Bacon's music.  Among these are his manuscripts for songs, solo instrumental pieces, and small ensembles with or without voice or voices. There is also a section of untitled holographs and photocopies of sketches and music workbooks with holographic annotation. Works are arranged alphabetically by title and cross-referenced when appropriate.  There are also 30 pages of undeveloped titles sketches, which come from what Ernst Bacon called his woodpile, these have been alphabetized and foldered together.</p>
         <p>The Writings Series consists of two subseries, poetry and prose.  Both subseries contain published and unpublished works written by Ernst Bacon and arranged alphabetically by title.  Included among the Prose subseries are many of his letters to various editors.  These are included here because of the highly expository nature of the writing, which is more like prose than typical correspondence. The Collection also contains many notebooks which Bacon used for his prose writings.  Although music is not the main emphasis of these materials, there are some musical jottings.</p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series, is divided into two subseries, Family and General.  The  Family Correspondence Subseries contains all correspondence received by Ernst Bacon from his family.  It also includes letters written by Ernst Bacon to family members.  All correspondence files are arranged alphabetically by author and in chronological order therein.  All correspondence written to family members by Ernst Bacon is filed under the addressee in chronological order, with the exception of the correspondence of Ellen, Peggy, and Paul Bacon.  Letters of Ellen or Peggy to Ernst Bacon have been separated from letters of Ernst Bacon to them and then filed chronologically.  Letters of Ernst Bacon's son, Paul, includes materials from and about his estate.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the correspondence is found in the General Correspondence Subseries.  As mentioned above letters to the editor, which are usually found in this subseries, have been listed in prose subseries of the Writing series for the aformentioned reason. Contained here are letters from notable musicians and writers including Ernest Bloch, G. Whitefield Chadwick, and Vincent Persichetti, Carl Sandburg, and Thornton Wilder; there are also letters from everyone else who were not family.</p>
         <p>The Iconography Series contains photographs, artwork, and posters.  Among the photographs are portraits of Ernst Bacon alone, Bacon with his father and mother and various family members, etc.  Some of the art is in Ernst Bacon's hand.  A notable piece of art in the collection is the original caricature of Ernst Bacon by the artist Sotomayor.  This series also contains posters advertising performances given by Ernst Bacon from 1918.</p>
         <p>The Miscellaneous Series comprises academic material dating from Ernst Bacon's undergraduate years, two appointment books, a Who's Who certificate, clippings from 1920-76, financial/legal papers dating from 1907-77, lists of various kind, some dated and some undated, a radio interview with Ernst Bacon, programs, publicity releases, and writings by others.</p>

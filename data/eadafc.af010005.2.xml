		  Legislation Collection consists of manuscript materials (1975-1995) compiled by
		  the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, documenting the history of
		  legislative efforts to designate the square dance as a national or state folk
		  dance. The bulk of the materials concerns the public hearing on House
		  Resolution 1706 held June 28,1984 before the Subcommittee on Census and
		  Population of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of
		  Representatives, 98th Congress to "designate the square dance as the national
		  folk dance of the United States." </abstract>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Square Dance Legislation Collection consists primarily of
		  correspondence, copies of proposed legislation, newspaper clippings, magazine
		  articles, and other publications that document the history of legislative
		  efforts to designate the square dance as the national folk dance. The
		  collection also includes material concerning related efforts at the state
		  level. It spans the years 1975 to 1995, with the largest portion concerning the
		  public hearing on House Resolution 1706 in 1984. National Western-style square
		  dance organizations have fostered a movement to add square dance to the list of
		  national symbols. Between 1965 and 1995, more than thirty bills were introduced
		  at the federal level. Their efforts also have focused on passing legislation at
		  the state level; by 1995 at least 17 states had designated square dance as the
		  official folk dance of that state. </p>
      </scopecontent>
      <bioghist id="mferd145e96" encodinganalog="545">
         <head>Administrative History and/or Biographical History</head>
         <p>This collection arose out of the American Folklife Center's 1984
		  involvement with the House Subcommittee on Census and Population, which was
		  then responsible for reviewing commemorative measures. This subcommittee turned
		  to the Center for assistance and guidance in planning and developing the public
		  hearing on H.R. 1706, a bill designating the square dance as the national dance
		  of the United States. As an expert in American folk culture, Gerald E. Parsons,
		  Reference Librarian for the Archive of Folk Culture, was detailed to help
		  organize the hearing. The materials he accumulated for this task form the basis
		  of this collection. Hearing testimonies, newspaper and magazine articles, and
		  editorials in the collection provide insight into the perspectives of both
		  proponents and opponents, while government documents trace the official
		  legislative history.</p>
